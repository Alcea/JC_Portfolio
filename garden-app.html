          <p class="min-length">Garden to Table is an iOS application that teaches users how to plant, harvest, and cook herb dishes. This project was created in a team of four members. My role in this project was concept and user research, user testing the prototype and assistant designer. During the research process, we found out that the younger generations living in cities rarely have experiences of taking care of plants, however their shared concern of dietary health has been increasing over the past few years.

          <p>The design problem given was to create an initial proposal for an application in any domain that will be approved by our professor which we will then make the application itself. The team concluded on the lifestyle domain to improve the living standards of users through a gardening application.</p>

          <p class="min-length">
          I was the primary researcher for this project so all the steps in the gardening and harvesting process were researched by me using reliable online gardening resources from veteran farmers like Steve Albert with the help of teammates that already have existing gardening knowledge.

          <p>
          I created a survey regarding the experiences and preferences of millennials ages 18-34 in order to find if the application was worth doing.

          The pool of data was of 19 individuals which I referred back to the consented users for user testing using the think-aloud test of having the person say aloud their process while navigating through the prototype and recording the session.

          <p>
          The sample size is small due to time restraints given for the project milestones. For the application itself, I participated the prototyping stages and designed the final iteration of the onboarding in the application as well as the herb selection process.
